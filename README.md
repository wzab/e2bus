# E2Bus - control of FPGA-based systems via Ethernet interface
E2Bus is a system for control of local bus in FPGA via Ethernet interface (either 1Gb/s or 100 Mb/s). It is inspired by the IPbus protocol ( http://github.com/ipbus ), but is aimed to further reduction of FPGA usage and providing additional functionalities. It utilizes the concept described in https://doi.org/doi:10.1117/12.2205441 .
Currently the first "proof of the concept" implementation is only available. The library allowing to generate the E2Bus commands from Python code is currently under development and will be published soon.
Short description of E2Bus was presented on TWEPP 2018 conference: https://indico.cern.ch/event/697988/contributions/3056146/ .
