# E2Bus - system for control of FPGA-based systems via Ethernet interface
E2Bus is a system for control of local bus in FPGA via Ethernet interface (either 1Gb/s or 100 Mb/s). It is inspired by the IPbus protocol ( http://github.com/ipbus ), but is aimed to further reduction of FPGA usage and providing additional functionalities. It utilizes the concept described in https://doi.org/doi:10.1117/12.2205441 .
The source code of both firmware and software will be published soon.
